# friends
This dataset contain a plain text description of graphs that represent each episode of the TV show "Friends". This dataset was manually generated and curated by Prof. Ana Bazzan (www.inf.ufrgs.br/ ~bazzan). If you use this dataset please acknowledge the source (this repository) and/or the following publication: https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04408

It can be used as input files to software that process graphs such as igraph. However, the current dataset has lines that are to be interpreted as comments as, e.g., lines that mark the beginning of a given episode; also, some lines include comments regarding specific types of episodes (e.g., Thanksgiving). To use this dataset in igraph, you need to parse using regular expressions.
